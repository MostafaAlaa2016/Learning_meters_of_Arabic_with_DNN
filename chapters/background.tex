\chapter{\uppercase{Background}}
Each Arabic letter represents a consonant, which means that short vowels are not
represented by the 36 characters, for this reason, the need of \textit{diacritics}
rises. \textit{Diacritics} are symbols that comes after a letter to state the
short vowel accompanied by that letter. There are four diacritics \textarabic{◌َ} \textarabic{◌ُ}
\textarabic{◌ِ} \textarabic{◌ْ} which represent the following short vowels
/\textit{a}/, /\textit{u}/, /\textit{i}/ and \textit{no-vowel} respectively,
their names are \textit{fat-ha, dam-ma, kas-ra and sukun} respectively.  The first
three symbols are called \textit{harakat}. Table \ref{tables:diacritics_dal}
shows the 4 diacritics on a letter.

There are two more sub-diacritics made up of the basic four to represent two
cases:
\begin{definition}\label{def:shadaa_definition}
  \textbf{Shadaa}  \hfill \\
to indicate the letter is doubled. Any letter with
shaddah (\textarabic{ ّ } ) the letter should be duplicated: first letter with a
constant (sukoon) and second letter with a vowel (haraka) \cite{Alnagdawi2013}; Table  \ref{tables:shadda_dal}
shows the dal with shadda and the original letters.

 Arabs pronounce the sound \textit{/n/} accompanied \textit{sukun} at the end the indefinite words, that sound corresponds to this
letter \textarabic{نْ}, it is called \textit{noon-sakinah}, however, it is
just a phone, it is not a part of the indefinite word, if a word comes as a
definite word, no additional sound is added. Since it is not an essential sound,
it is not written as a letter, but it is written as  \textit{tanween}
\textarabic{◌ٌ ◌ً ◌ٍ}.
% adding tanween and its relationship to the previous letter
\textit{Tanween} states the sound \textit{noon-sakinah}, but as you have noticed,
there are 3 \textit{tanween} symbols, this because  \textit{tanween} is added as
a diacritic over the last letter of the indefinite word, one of the 3 harakat\textit{harakat} accompanies the last letter, the last letter's \textit{harakah}
needs to be stated in addition to the sound \textit{noon-sakinah}, so
\textit{tanween} is doubling the last letter's \textit{haraka}, this way the last
letter's \textit{haraka} is preserved in addition to stating the sound
\textit{noon-sakinah}; for example, \textarabic{رَجُلُ + نْ} is written
\textarabic{رَجُلٌ} and  \textarabic{رَجُلِ + نْ} is written \textarabic{رَجُلٍ}. 


Those two definition, Definition ~\ref{def:shadaa_definition} and Definition ~\ref{def:tanween_definition}  will help us to reduce the dimension of the letter's feature vector as we will see in \textit{preparing data} section.


Diacritics makes short vowels clearer, but they are not necessary.
Moreover, a phrase without full diacritics or with just some on some letters is
right linguistically, so it is allowed to drop them from the text.

% Diacritics in Unicode
In Unicode, Arabic diacritics are standalone symbols, each of them has its own
unicode. This is in contrast to the Latin diacritics; e.g., in the set
\textit{\{ê, é, è, ë, ē, ĕ, ě\}}, each combination of the letter \textit{e} and a diacritic is represented by one unicode.

\section{Arabic Arud Science}
reference is the book .... to be added
\begin{definition}\label{def:arud}
  \textbf{Arud} \hfill \\
In Arabic Arud natively has many meanings (the way, the direction, the light clouds and Mecca and Madinah\footnote{\textit{Mecca and Madinah are two cities in  Saudi Arabia}.}. Arud is the science which studies The Arabic Poem meters and the rules which confirm if the Poem is sound meters \& broken meters. It named Arud because some people said he put this science in Arud place \textarabic{العَروض} \textit{with fat-ha, not with dam-ma such as the science name \textarabic{العُروض} } between Mecca and Madinah.
\end{definition}

The Author of this science is \textit{Al-Farahidi} (718 – 786 CE) has analyzed the
Arabic poetry; then he came up with that the succession of consonants and vowels
produce patterns or \textit{meters}, which make the music of poetry. He was one of the famous people who know The melodies and the musical parts of speech. He has
counted them fifteen meters.  After that, a student of \textit{Al-Farahidi} has
added one more meter to make them sixteen. Arabs call meters \textarabic{بحور}
which means "\textit{seas}." Poets have written poems without knowing exactly what rules which make a collection of words a poem.

The Reasons which makes \textit{Al-Farahidi} put this science is

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Protect the Arabic Poems from the broken meters.
  \item Distinguish between the original Arabic Poem and the non-poem or from the prose.
    \item Make the rules clear and easy for anyone who needs to write a poem.
  \end{itemize}
  
    Some people said that the one-day Al-Farahidi was walking into the metal-market and he was said some of the poems and for some reasons the knock of the metals matched the musical sound of the poem he was saying then he got an idea to explore the Arud of the poems.
\newpage
    \subsection{Feet Representation}
    A meter is an ordered sequence of feet. Feet are the basic
units of meters; there are ten of them.
\begin{definition}\label{def:feet}
  \textbf{Feet} \hfill \\  A Foot consists of
a sequence of \textbf{Sukun} (Consonants) represented as (0) and \textbf{Harakah} (Vowels) (/). Traditionally, feet are represented by mnemonic words called tafa’il \textarabic{تفاعيل}.
\end{definition}

Feets consists of three parts (Reasons \textarabic{أسباب}, Wedge \textarabic{وتد}, Breaks \textarabic{فواصل}).
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Reasons (\textarabic{أسباب})}: It has two types
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Light (\textarabic{سبب خفيف})} which happens when we have the first letter is harakah and the second is sukun (/0) example (\textarabic{هَبْ, لَمْ}).
    \item \textbf{Heavy (\textarabic{سبب ثقيل})} which happens when we have two harakah letter (//) example (\textarabic{لَكَ, بِكَ}).
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Wedge (\textarabic{وتد})}: It has two types
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Combined Wedge (\textarabic{وتد مجموع})} which happens when we have two harakah letters followed by sukun (//0) example (\textarabic{مَشَى, عَلَى}).
    \item \textbf{Separated Wedge (\textarabic{وتد مفروق})} which happens when we have two harakah and in between a sukun letter (/0/) example (\textarabic{مُنْذُ, مِصْرُ}).
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Breaks (\textarabic{فواصل}}): It has two types
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Small Break (\textarabic{فاصلة صغرى}}) which happens when we have three harakah letters followed by a sukun letter (///0) example (\textarabic{ذَهَبُوا, سُفُناً}).
    \item \textbf{Big Break (\textarabic{فاصلة كبرى}}) which happens when we have four harakah letters followed by a sukun letter  (////0) example (\textarabic{جَعَلَهُمْ}).\footnote{\textit{Some of Arab linguistic scientist assume the small Breaks as a combination between big reason and small reason. Same for the Big Breaks assumed to be a combination between Big reason and Combined Wedge. So, they didn't assume we have three types of feet it is only pure two and any other feets constructed from this two. In this thesis we assume there are three feets }.}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{itemize}

  \subsubsection{Rules for Arabic Letters Representation}
  Arabic letter has one general rule in the poem representation which is we represent only the letters which is (spoken) not the written which means the letters with phonatics not the written. We have give the below rules as a results of the general rule.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Any letter with \textit{harakah} represented as (/).
  \item Any letter with \textit{sukun} represented as (0).
  \item Any letter with shaddah represented by two letters the first one will be \textit{sukun} and the second letter will be \textit{harakah} represented as (0/) example (\textarabic{مُحَمََّد}) will be (//0//0).
  \item Any letter with tanween represented by two letters the first one is \textit{haraka} (/) and the second is \textit{sukun}.
  \item Alef without hamze (\textarabic{همزة الوصل}) and Wow Algmaa are not represented example (\textarabic{وُاعلَموا}) will be (/0//0)
  \item If we have a letter which is not written but (spoken) so, we will represent it example (\textarabic{هذا}) it include Alef but not written (\textarabic{هاذا}) the representation will be (/0/0).
  \item If we have \textit{Meem Aljamaa} with harakah so, it represented with \textit{Mad} example (\textarabic{هُمُ}) will be (//0) .
  \item \textit{Alef Mad} (\textarabic{آ}) will be two letters \textit{Alef with harakah} and \textit{Alef with sukun} example (\textarabic{آدَمُ}) will be (/0//).
    \item if the verse ended with \textit{harkah} we will add \textit{sukun} to it.
    
    
    \end{itemize}
Exampel: (note: the below representation is not complete )
\begin{Arabic}
	\begin{traditionalpoem*}
وَجَدتُ الناسَ مَيتاً مِثلَ حَيٍّ *** بِحُسنِ الذِكرِ أَو حَيّاً كَمَيتِ
وَجَدْتُنْنَاْ سَمَيْتَنْمِثْ لَحَيْيِنْ *** بِحُسْنِذْذِكْ رِأَوْحَيْيَنْ كَمَيْتِيْ

\subsection{Arabic Poetry Feets}

Arabic poetry feets has ten tafa'il \textarabic{تفاعيل} (scansion)  any peom constructed from these feets. They are eight from writing (syntax) prespective, But it ten in the rules.

\subsection{Arabic Poetry Meters}

\subsubsection{Al-Taweel \arabictext{الطويل}}
Al-Taweel is named Al-Taweel for two reasons; first, It is the longest meter between all meters. Second, It starts with Wedge then Reasons and Wedge is longer than Reasons. So, it named Al-Taweel. We need here to note later in the encoding section we will pad all other meters by zeros to make it all the same length. Example if the max Bayt is 82 so, any Bayt less than 82 will be padded by zeros to have the same length.



Example Of Al-Taweel:

\begin{Arabic}
	\begin{traditionalpoem*}
          إذا جادَ أقوامٌ بِمالٍ رأيْتَهُمْ  *** يَجودونَ بالأرواحِ مِنْهُم بِلا بُخلِ
          //0/0 //0/0/0 //0/0 //0//0 *** //0/0 //0/0/0 //0/0 //0/0/0 
          فعلون مفاعيلن فعولن مفاعلن *** فعولن مفاعيلن فعولن مفاعيلن
