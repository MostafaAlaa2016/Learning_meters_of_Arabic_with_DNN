\chapter{\uppercase{Introduction}}


Arabic is the fifth most widely spoken language\footnote{\textit{according to the
		20th edition of Ethnologue, 2017}}. It is written from right to left. Its
alphabet consists of 28 primary letters, and there are 8 more derived letters
from the basic ones, so the total count of Arabic characters is 36 characters.
The writing system is cursive; hence, most letters join to the letter that comes
after them, a few letters remain disjoint.

% Introduction to diacritics: ?
Each Arabic letter represents a consonant, which means that short vowels are not
represented by the 36 characters, for this reason, the need of \textit{diacritics}
rises. \textit{Diacritics} are symbols that comes after a letter to state the
short vowel accompanied by that letter. There are four diacritics \textarabic{◌َ} \textarabic{◌ُ}
\textarabic{◌ِ} \textarabic{◌ْ} which represent the following short vowels
/\textit{a}/, /\textit{u}/, /\textit{i}/ and \textit{no-vowel} respectively,
their names are \textit{fat-ha, dam-ma, kas-ra and sukun} respectively.  The first
three symbols are called \textit{harakat}. Table \ref{arabic:diacritics_dal}
shows the 4 diacritics on a letter.

There are two more sub-diacritics made up of the basic four to represent two
cases: the first case is when a letter is doubled where the first letter is
accompanied by \textit{sukun} and the second letter is accompanied by
\textit{haraka}, instead of doubling each letter accompanied by their
\textit{diacritics} explicitly, both of them are written once accompanied by
\textit{shadda} \textarabic{◌ّ}, \textit{shadda} states that its letter is
doubled, the first letter is always accompanied by \textit{sukun}, the second
letter's \textit{haraka} is followed by \textit{shadda}; for example,
\textarabic{دْدَ} is written \textarabic{دَّ}.
% the issue
The second case, Arabs pronounce the sound \textit{/n/} accompanied
\textit{sukun} at the end the indefinite words, that sound corresponds to this
letter \textarabic{نْ}, it is called \textit{noon-sakinah}, however, it is
just a phone, it is not a part of the indefinite word, if a word comes as a
definite word, no additional sound is added. Since it is not an essential sound,
it is not written as a letter, but it is written as  \textit{tanween}
\textarabic{◌ٌ ◌ً ◌ٍ}.
% adding tanween and its relationship to the previous letter
\textit{Tanween} states the sound \textit{noon-sakinah}, but as you have noticed,
there are 3 \textit{tanween} symbols, this because  \textit{tanween} is added as
a diacritic over the last letter of the indefinite word, last letter is
accompanied by one of the 3 \textit{harakat}, the last letter's \textit{harakah}
needs to be stated in addition to the sound \textit{noon-sakinah}, so
\textit{tanween} is doubling the last letter's \textit{haraka}, this way the last
letter's \textit{haraka} is preserved in addition to stating the sound
\textit{noon-sakinah}; for example, \textarabic{رَجُلُ + نْ} is written
\textarabic{رَجُلٌ} and  \textarabic{رَجُلِ + نْ} is written \textarabic{رَجُلٍ}.


Those two cases will help us to reduce the dimension of the letter's feature vector as we
will see in \textit{preparing data} section.

\end{table}


Diacritics are just to make short vowels clearer, but they are not necessary.
Moreover, a phrase without full diacritics or with just some on some letters is
right linguistically, so it is allowed to drop them from text.

% Diacritics in Unicode
In Unicode, Arabic diacritics are standalone symbols, each of them has its own
unicode. This is in contrast to the Latin diacritics; e.g., in the set
\textit{\{ê, é, è, ë, ē, ĕ, ě\}}, each combination of the letter \textit{e} and a diacritic is represented by one unicode.


\section{Arabic Poetry \textarabic{الشعر العربى}}
%% Introduction; the circumstances before alarud
Arabic poetry is the earliest form of Arabic literature. It dates back to the sixth century. Poets have written poems without knowing exactly what rules which make a collection of words a poem. People recognize poetry by nature, but only talented ones who could write poems. %
% What al-Farahidi did
This was the case until \textit{Al-Farahidi} (718 – 786 CE) has analyzed the
Arabic poetry, then he came up with that the succession of consonants and vowels
produce patterns or \textit{meters}, which make the music of poetry.  He has
counted them fifteen meters.  After that, a student of \textit{Al-Farahidi} has
added one more meter to make them sixteen. Arabs call meters \textarabic{بحور}
which means "\textit{seas}".

% \textbf{Some conventions and terminologies}:

% What are poems and terminologies?
% What does a poem look like? bayt, shatr, ....
\begin{Arabic}
	\begin{traditionalpoem*}

 ويوم موعدهم أن يُحشروا زُمرا يوم التغابن إذ لا ينفع الحذر

	\end{traditionalpoem*}
\end{Arabic}%
A verse, known as \textit{bayt} in Arabic, consists of two halves; a half is
called a \textit{shatr}\footnote{it is a singular in arabic, but for simplicity
	we will use it for both singular and plural.}. %
% Meters and Feet
\textit{Al-Farahidi} has introduced \textit{al-'arud
	\textarabic{العروض}}\footnote{it is often called the \textit{Knowledge of
		Poetry}.}; it is the study of poetic meters, in which he has laid down rigorous
rules and measures, with them we can determine whether a meter of a poem is sound
or broken. A meter is an ordered sequence of \textit{feet}. Feet are the basic
units of meters, there are eight of them. A Foot consists of a sequence of
consonant and vowels. Traditionally, feet are represented by mnemonic words
called \textit{tafa'il} (\textarabic{تفاعيل}).  According to \textit{al-Farahidi}
and his student, there are sixteen combinations of \textit{tafa'il}. A meter
appears in a \textit{verse} twice; each \textit{shatr} carries the same complete
meter.%

	\caption{The eight feet. Every digit represents the corresponding diacritic
		over each latter in the feet. \texttt{/} If a letter has got \textit{harakat} (
		\textarabic{◌َ} \textarabic{◌ُ} \textarabic{◌ِ}), \texttt{0} if a letter has got
		\textit{sukun} (\textarabic{◌ْ}). Any \textit{mad} (\textarabic{و, ا, ى}) is
		equivalent to \textit{sukun}.}\label{arud:feet}
\end{table}


For example, the following \textit{shatr} \textarabic{وَيُسأَلُ في الحَوادِثِ ذو صَوابٍ} is
equivalent to the \textit{meter} \textarabic{مفاعلتن مفاعلتن فعول}, which means
it belongs to \textit{Al-Wafeer} meter. We can get the pattern of the
\textit{sukun} and \textit{harakat} by replacing each feet by the corresponding
code in table \ref{arud:feet}, which produces the following pattern that should
be read from right to left:%
\begin{flushright}
	{\texttt{0/0// 0///0// 0///0//}} % You have to filp it.
\end{flushright}
This is a very brief introduction to \textit{Arud}, many details are reduced.

\section{Thesis Objectives}

Detecting the meter of poems is not an easy task for ordinary people, but how
computers will perform? Our task is to train a model so that it can detect the
meter of the input verse/text.
We have worked on Arabic and English in parallel, everything thing is applied to
Arabic is applied also in English, as possible as we can.

To be clearer, the model's input is a verse/text \textarabic{بيت شعر} and the
output is a class which is the verse's meter \textarabic{البحر}, as shown in the
figure below.

	\node at (6, 1.5) {Meter};
	\node at (6, 1) {\textarabic{البحْرُ}};
	
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

The output variable is a class/categorical, then our problem can be described as
\textit{supervised learning  classification}.  We have trained some deep learning
models such as LSTM, Bi-LSTM and GRU.  Those models are chosen because of the
nature of our problem. We were trying to detect the verse's meter, which is a
sequence of characters and \textit{recurrent neural network} are suitable  to
learn that pattern, thanks to its cell's share-memory and its recursive
structure.

\section{Thesis Outline}

The coming chapters are arranged as follows:

 Chapter 2: presents some basic background knowledge as regarded to the anatomy of the human retina, the pathophysiology of the diabetic macular edema, the imaging modality or the fluorescein angiography and finally, the physicians evaluation based on it.
 
 Chapter 3: introduces the essential pre-processing steps, and the justification for their need. Pre-processing steps are vessel extraction, image registration, camera correction and intensity normalization, applied to the used frames.
 
 Chapter 4: presents three methods for quantitatively assessing DME, in which the different indices are computed independant of any segmentation steps. Validation is next done for each of the methods, with respect to their corresponding disease severity, represented by the amount of fluorescein leakage (\cite{g}), which are manually segmented by two opthalmology experts. 
 
 Chapter 5: describes several methods of segmentation of leakage caused by DME based on referring the late time frame macula to the early time maculas(s). Results are validated through measuring the the sensitivity and specificity of the automatic segmentation on a pixel-wise basis with respect to the manual grading of two ophthalmology experts.
 
 Chapter 6: Results and discussion.
 
 Chapter 7 \& 8: Conclusion and future work
