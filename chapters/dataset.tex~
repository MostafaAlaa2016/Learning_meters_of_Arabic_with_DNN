We have scrapped the Arabic dataset from two big poetry websites:
\textarabic{الديوان}\footnote{\textit{aldiwan.net}}, \textarabic{الموسوعة
	الشعرية}\footnote{\textit{poetry.tcaabudhabi.ae}}. Both are merged into one large
dataset. It is important to note that the verses' diacritic states are not
consistent, this means that a verse can carry full, semi diacritics or it can
carry nothing. The total number of verses is  1,862,046 poetic verses; each verse is
labeled by its meter, the poet who wrote it, and the
age which it was written in. There are 22 meters, 3701 poets and 11
ages; and they are Pre-Islamic, Islamic, Umayyad, Mamluk, Abbasid, Ayyubid, Ottoman,
Andalusian, era between Umayyad and Abbasid, Fatimid and modern.  We are only
interested  in the 16 classic meters which are attributed to \textit{Al-Farahidi},
and they are the majority of the dataset with a total number of 1,722,321
% NOTE: change the public rep.
