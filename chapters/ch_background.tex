In this chapter, We will give background knowledge as regards the Arabic Poetry and Al-Arud studies
rules and details. Also, it will contain basic knowledge of Deep Learning concepts with Literature
review for the previous work in this problem area.

Each Arabic letter represents a consonant, which means that short vowels are not
represented by the 36 characters, for this reason, the need of \textit{diacritics}
arises. \textit{Diacritics} are symbols that comes after a letter to state the
short vowel accompanied by that letter. There are four diacritics \textarabic{◌َ} \textarabic{◌ُ}
\textarabic{◌ِ} \textarabic{◌ْ} which represent the following short vowels
/\textit{a}/, /\textit{u}/, /\textit{i}/ and \textit{no-vowel} respectively,
their names are \textit{fat-ha, dam-ma, kas-ra and sukun} respectively.  The first
three symbols are called \textit{harakat}. Table~\ref{Tab:Diacritics_Dal}
shows the 4 diacritics on a letter.
There are two more sub-diacritics made up of the basic four to represent two
cases: \textit{Shadaa} and \textit{Tanween}%
\begin{definition}\label{def:shadaa_definition}
  \textbf{Shadaa}  \hfill \\
  is To indicate the letter is doubled. Any letter with shaddah (\textarabic{ ّ }) the letter should be duplicated: first letter with a constant (sukoon) and second letter with a vowel (haraka)~\cite{Alnagdawi2013}; Table~\ref{Tab:Diacritics_Dal} shows the dal with shadda and the original letters.% table: dal with shadda
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}\label{def:tanween_definition}
  \textbf{Tanween} \hfill \\
  is doubling the short vowel, and can convert \textit{Tanween fathah}, \textit{Tanween dhammah} or \textit{Tanween kasrah} by replacing it with the appropriate vowel (\textarabic{◌ُ} – dhammah, textarabic{◌َ} – fathah or \textarabic{◌ِ} –kasrah ) then add the \textit{Noon} letter with constant to the end of the word~\cite{Alnagdawi2013}. Table~\ref{Tab:Tanween_Dal}
  shows the difference between the original letter and the letter with \textit{Tanween}%
\end{definition}%

Arabs pronounce the sound \textit{/n/} accompanied \textit{sukun} at the end the indefinite words,
that sound corresponds to this letter \textarabic{نْ}, it is called \textit{noon-sakinah}, however,
it is just a phone, it is not a part of the indefinite word, if a word comes as a definite word, no
additional sound is added. Since it is not an essential sound, it is not written as a letter, but it
is written as \textit{tanween} \textarabic{◌ٌ ◌ً ◌ٍ}.
% adding tanween and its relationship to the previous letter
\textit{Tanween} states the sound \textit{noon-sakinah}, but as you have noticed,
there are 3 \textit{tanween} symbols, this because  \textit{tanween} is added as
a diacritic over the last letter of the indefinite word, one of the 3 harakat\textit{harakat} accompanies the last letter, the last letter's \textit{harakah}
needs to be stated in addition to the sound \textit{noon-sakinah}, so
\textit{tanween} is doubling the last letter's \textit{haraka}, this way the last
letter's \textit{haraka} is preserved in addition to stating the sound
\textit{noon-sakinah}; for example, \textarabic{رَجُلُ + نْ} is written
\textarabic{رَجُلٌ} and  \textarabic{رَجُلِ + نْ} is written \textarabic{رَجُلٍ}.

Those two definition, Definition ~\ref{def:shadaa_definition} and
Definition~\ref{def:tanween_definition} will help us to reduce the dimension of the letter's feature
vector as we will see in \textit{preparing data} section.%
Diacritics makes short vowels clearer, but they are not necessary.  Moreover, a phrase without full
diacritics or with just some on some letters is right linguistically, so it is allowed to drop them
from the text. In Unicode, Arabic diacritics are standalone symbols, each of them has its own
unicode. This is in contrast to the Latin diacritics; e.g., in the set \textit{\{ê, é, è, ë, ē, ĕ,
  ě\}}, each combination of the letter \textit{e} and a diacritic is represented by one unicode.
