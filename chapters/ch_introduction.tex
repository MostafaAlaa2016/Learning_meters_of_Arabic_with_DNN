%\begin{spacing}{1.5}\section*{\LARGE{\mdseries{Thesis Outline}}}

In this chapter, We will give an introduction and basic background knowledge as regards the Arabic language. Also, it will contain details about Arabic Poetry history and the aim of this thesis.

  Arabic is the fifth most widely spoken language~\cite{Ethnologue_2017}. It is written from right to left. Its
alphabet consists of 28 primary letters, and there are 8 more derived letters
from the basic ones, so the total count of Arabic characters is 36 characters.
The writing system is cursive; hence, most letters join to the letter that comes
after them, a few letters remain disjoint.

\section{Arabic Poetry } %%
%% Introduction; the circumstances before alarud
Arabic poetry(\textarabic{الشعر العربى}) is the earliest form of Arabic literature. It dates back to the Sixth century. Poets have written poems without knowing exactly what rules which make a collection of words a poem. People recognize poetry by nature, but only talented ones can write poems. This was the case until \textit{Al-Farahidi} (718 – 786 CE) has analyzed the
Arabic poetry, then he came up with that the succession of consonants and vowels
produce patterns or \textit{meters}, which make the music of poetry.  He has
counted them fifteen meters.  After that, a student of \textit{Al-Farahidi} has
added one more meter to make them sixteen. Arabs call meters \textarabic{بحور}
which means ``\textit{seas}''. The study of Arabic Poetry Meter Classification is named \textbf{Al-Arud (\textarabic{العَروض})}. It takes too much time for anyone to be an expert in this field. 
\section{Deep Learning}

Deep Learning also named Deep Neural Network is part of Machine Learning algorithms. Deep Learning is trying to simulate the human brain into Neural dependency.  Using Deep Learning, we can achieve better learning results from the data. Deep Neural Network needs a huge amount of data to achieve the expected learning curve and results. It also needs a massive amount of computation to build the networks which are based on an artificial neural network. We used the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to work on the Arabic Text which shown its ability to achieve outstanding performance over the text problem data. We also used LSTM to solve the long dependency issue in RNN. We will go deep into the Background section (add deep learning section reference).

\section{Thesis Objectives}
In this section, we need to explain the reason behind this project as a research idea. This project aimed to explore the Arabic language feature using well known studied rules which is Al-Arud. This exploration will help us understand how can machine learning model to understand the features of Arabic language without Hand-crafted the feature or static rule-based models.

This will be a basic step to get deeper into the language and later we can have more robust machine learning models which can not only understand and classify the Poem/poetry but also, we can generate a similar text with the model without breaking the rules. All the previous are first steps toward a deeper understanding of the Arabic language features and rules using deep learning techniques. This research can open ideas about how the machine understanding the Arabic Grammar rules which will lead to new ideas to generate better Arabic text model.

As this research is the first to address classifying poem meters in a machine learning approach. This research aims to have a deep understanding of the Arabic language grammar and features in the Poem meters classification and will be a base for another research related to the poem analysis problem.


In this study, we work on Poetry Meter Classification and use the latest technologies to check the class of poem. We also worked to achieve near human expert results which make our work is a breakthrough in the field concerning the results compared to the current achieved results. Figure~\ref{Fig:Thesis_Cycle} shows the steps. First, We Crawled the data from the available sources with labeling. Second, Clean, transform and encode the data. Finally, Train, Validate, and Enhance the RNN model into the cleaned data.
