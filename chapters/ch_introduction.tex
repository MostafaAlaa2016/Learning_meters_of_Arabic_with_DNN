In this chapter, we will give an introduction and basic background knowledge as regards the Arabic language. It will contain details about Arabic Poetry history and the aim of this thesis.

  Arabic is the fifth most widely spoken language~\cite{Ethnologue_2017}. It is written from right to left. Its
alphabet consists of 28 primary letters, 8 letters derived from the basic ones, so the total count of Arabic characters is 36 characters. The writing system is cursive; hence, most letters join to the letter that comes
after them, althougha few letters remain unconnected.

\section{Arabic Poetry } %%
%% Introduction; the circumstances before alarud
Arabic poetry(\textarabic{الشعر العربى}) is the earliest form of Arabic literature. It dates back to the sixth century. Poets have written poems without knowing exactly what rules render a collection of words a poem. People recognize poetry by nature, but only talented ones can write poems. This was the case until \textit{Al-Farahidi} (718 – 786 CE) analyzed the Arabic poetry; he noted that the succession of consonants and vowels produce patterns or \textit{meters}, which make the music of poetry. He counted fifteen meters. Thereafter, a student of \textit{Al-Farahidi} added one more meter to make sixteen. Arabs call meters \textarabic{بحور} which means ``\textit{seas}''. The study of Arabic Poetry Meter Classification is named \textbf{Al-Arud (\textarabic{العَروض})}. It takes much time to become an expert in this field. 
\section{Deep Learning}

Deep Learning, also named Deep Neural Network, is part of Machine Learning algorithms. Deep Learning attempts to simulate the human brain into neural dependency.  Using Deep Learning, we can achieve better learning results from the data. Deep Neural Network needs a huge amount of data to achieve the expected learning curve and results. It also needs a massive amount of computation to build the networks, which are based on an artificial neural network. We used the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to work on the Arabic text, showing its ability to achieve outstanding performance over the text problem data. We also used LSTM to solve the long dependency issue in RNN~\ref{Sec:Deep_Learning_Background}.

\section{Thesis Objectives}
This section explains the reason behind this project as a research idea. This project aims to explore the Arabic language feature using established Al-Arud rules. This exploration will help us understand how to use a machine learning model to understand Arabic language features without hand-crafted features or static rule-based models.

This will be a basic step to get deeper into the language and, later not only can we have more robust machine learning models which understand and classify the Poem/poetry, but we can also generate a similar text with the model without breaking the rules. All the previous are first steps toward a deeper understanding of the Arabic language features and rules using deep learning techniques. This research can open ideas about how machine understanding of Arabic Grammar rules will lead to new ideas to generate better Arabic text models.

This research is the first to address classifying poem meters via a machine learning approach. It aims to have a deep understanding of Arabic language grammar and features in the Poem meters classification and will be a base for further research related to the poem analysis problem.

In this study, we work on Poetry Meter Classification and use the latest technologies to check the class of poem. We also work to achieve near human expert results which make our work a breakthrough in the field concerning the results compared to previous results. Figure~\ref{Fig:Thesis_Cycle} shows the steps. First, we derived the data from the available sources with labeling. Second, the clean data was transformed and encoded. Finally, the cleaned data was trained, validated, and enhanced into the RNN model.
