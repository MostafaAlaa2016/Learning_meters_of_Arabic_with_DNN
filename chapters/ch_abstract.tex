People can easily determine whether a piece of writing is a poem or prose, but only specialists can determine the class of poem.

In this thesis, we built a model that can classify poetry according to its meters; a forward step towards machine understanding of the Arabic language.

A number of different deep learning models are proposed for poem meter classification. As poetry is sequence data, then recurrent neural networks are suitable for the task. We have trained three variants of them; LSTM, GRU with different architectures and hyper-parameters. Because meters are a sequence of characters, we have encoded the input text at the character-level, so that we preserve the information provided by the letters succession directly fed to the models. Moreover, we introduce a comparative study on the difference between \textit{binary} and \textit{one-hot} encoding regarding their effect on the learning curve. We also introduce a new encoding technique called \textit{two-hot}, which merges the advantages of both \textit{binary} and \textit{one-hot} techniques.

To the best of the authorâ€™s knowledge, this research is the first to address classifying poem meters with featureless technique in a machine learning approach, in general, and in RNN featureless based approach, in particular. In addition, the dataset is the first publicly available dataset prepared for the purpose of future computational research.
