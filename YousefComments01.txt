As agreed, I will not comment on phrasing, language, grammar, wordings, etc. However, it my happen
that I comment on some of these here or there. So, if I do, please do not consider them exclusive or
thorough. It will be just quick comments. In addition, I will not read every word now. Rather, this
review is to make sure that the order, content, and major science is sound (aside from phrasing and
exact wording). So, please consider the following comments as my first round. When done just let me
know to give it my second round before Dr. Samhaa. Thanks so much.

- I think the word "science" should not be used in "Arabic Arud Science". Science means experimental
  science. Rather, you simply may use "Arabic Arud". Also, when you talk about Alfarahidi and say
  "scientifically", this is not strictly right I think. You may use "rigorously" or "formally"
  ...However, "scientifically" conveys other meanings.

- In general, why you use citation in footnotes? For example, on P.28 you cite Rudin: "... and any
  \lambda where 0< ....8"; and in the footnote there is the citation of [8]. However, in "Reference"
  section there is another [8]. This is confusing. Please, make all citations consistently at the
  "Reference" section.

- I am Associate Professor; and my name is Waleed A. Yousef

- Why you do not use the Arabic Poem environment that we use in the paper? It will format the verses
  right for you, which will look very pretty.

- feet not feets.

- make sure you use "poem" and "poetry" right.

- Definition 3 is not complete "if we need to su ...".

- Regarding the reason behind naming each meter, I have read for one of the language scholars that
  this is too much pretending; simply there is no particular reason behind each name! For the
  purpose of the thesis, I think it will not harm if you drop these reasons. So, feel free to use
  whatever you feel comfortable with

- In Section 2.1.4, too much vertical spacing (I know it is a LaTeX issue that you may be able to
  fix it by using % between environments, etc.)

- Be consistent in using the Arabic-English names. So, for example keep using the word "meters"
  instead of "Bohor" with mentioning both at first time of use. (you can also use other conventions;
  but be consistent across the whole document).

- Section 2.1.5 is interesting; however, it is not clear from two prospective. (1) the figures are
  in Arabic; so, non-Arabs will not get it. (2) Even for Arabs, figures need explanation; e.g., few
  statements. But the section is quite interesting and you need to mention in it something like
  "these relationships may be beneficial in interpreting the confusion matrix and the per-class two
  types of errors ". Do you really need this important section to be represented as figures? Is it
  better to design simple tables? I am not sure. Anyway, it is an important section.

- It seems that you have problems in cross-referencing equations. E.g., on P.36, you say "... use
  linear function 2.14(c)"; it should be 2.21(c). Please, check ALL.

- Be consistent in using the names of functions, variables, etc. within-text. E.g., in text, you
  write "Tanh" with upper case and with normal font. Rather, it should be inside $$. Also, the use
  of "max" and all operators should be \max or \operatorname{...}

- Regarding Section 3.2, I think it should not be there; we removed it from the paper. This is
  because, indeed, there is no such approach in the literature. The citations in this section work
  on different problems NOT our problem of "recognizing meters from written poem".

- In Section 3.3 (comparison), avoid using subjective words, e.g., "excellent performance" without
  measure. You can list down the numbers.

- Chapters 4 and 5 can be lumped up to just one chapter, e.g., "Dataset: acquisition and
  encoding". Do you need all these section titles (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.3.1, 5.3.2, 5.3.3). I mean the
  paragraphs underneath each title is too little to be a section! Anyway, use your judgment.

- The information in Figures 6.1 and 4.1 is exactly the same; just a normalization by the dataset
  size. It can be confusing and certainly redundant; what is the need for that;

- Toooooooo much digits on P.62.

- In Eq. 6.1 (P.62) use another subscript (c') for the summation; (I will change that as well in the paper).
